## [2026-05-05 20:05] — self-review fixes + production deploy

**Area:** Trading/Market Data, Trading/Research, Trading/Ops
**Type:** code review + fixes + deploy
**Branch:** `master`

### What
- Reviewed Market Data Archive v1 work with two subagent review passes plus local review.
- Fixed repeated top-list false positives by making repeated-list reports MOVERS-only and using the full MOVERS cohort calendar before filtering reportable exits.
- Fixed price-streak stale-data risk by requiring an exact `prices_daily` close on the candidate date.
- Deduplicated same symbol/date/vector rows before repeated-list run detection.
- Escaped DB-backed text in generated HTML report cells.
- Made `sync-market-bars.ts` fail loudly on zero symbols/total failures, record `market_data_runs`, and support explicit `--allow-partial`.
- Added CSV quoted-field parsing/validation for optional SP500 seed input.
- Deduplicated archive schema definitions by importing the market archive statements into app migrations.

### Verification
```text
npx tsc --noEmit -> passed
npm test -> 10 files / 121 tests passed
npm run build -> passed
npx tsx scripts/sync-market-universe.ts -> upserted 647 rows across 584 symbols
npx tsx scripts/sync-market-bars.ts --source=MOVERS --limit=3 --min-bars=5 --allow-partial -> 66 bars, 0 failures

```

### Review Findings Fixed
- P1 repeated top-list reports included TREND rows.
- P2 repeated-list cohort dates could bridge gaps after filtering rows by exits.
- P2 midday-stop summary denominator included skipped rows.
- P1 bar sync could fail while exiting successfully.
- P2 simple CSV split could corrupt SP500 seed metadata.

## [2026-05-05 19:30] — research report refactor + verification

**Area:** Trading/Research, Trading/Market Data
**Type:** feature + verification
**Branch:** `codex/market-data-archive-v1`

### What
- Added report scripts for repeated top-list ticker paths, verified price-close streak reversal, combined price/repeated grid, and top-gainers hold/stop samples.
- Refactored repeated top-list and price-streak reports to use shared market-data research helpers.
- Standardized report wording around `Ticker`, `Candidate`, `Vector`, and `Sequence dates`; removed the older visible raw-span issue from generated HTML.
- Closed beads `trading-agx` and `trading-agx.4`.

### Verification

## [2026-05-05 19:05] — market data archive v1 verification

**Area:** Trading/Market Data, Trading/Research
**Type:** verification
**Branch:** `master`

### What
- Verified Market Data Archive v1 provider/schema/research helper scaffold.
- Smoke-tested universe sync and daily bar archive scripts against local VPS MySQL tunnel.
- Left `trading-agx.4` open for the next slice: refactor HTML reports to consume the shared helper layer.

### Verification
```text
npx tsc --noEmit -> passed
npx vitest run src/lib/market-data/research.test.ts -> 1 file / 5 tests passed
npx tsx scripts/sync-market-universe.ts -> upserted 647 rows across 584 symbols
npx tsx scripts/sync-market-bars.ts --source=MOVERS --limit=3 -> 66 bars, 0 failures
```

### Notes
- CLI sync scripts use a narrow archive-schema initializer instead of full app `ensureSchema()` to avoid triggering unrelated historical migrations/backfills over the SSH tunnel.
- MySQL writes are batched/retried for transient tunnel failures.

## [2026-04-30 11:13] — verification handoff + paper execution-cost prep

**Area:** Trading/Ops, Trading/Paper
**Type:** chore + verification + feature prep
**Branch:** integration to `master`

### Why
Verify production health/data fetching, make sure code is ready to serve from canonical `master`, and leave a clear install/deploy handoff for the next agent.

### What
- Verified Railway topology: `trading`, `worker`, `MySQL` in project `TRADING` / production.
- Added 2026-04-30 handoff with install, local-dev, deploy, and smoke-check instructions.
- Corrected root `AGENTS.md` to point at `.claude/*` instruction files and current Next.js version.
- Prepared paper execution-cost changes: spread-aware execution price, STOP-as-market fills, cost metrics, risk settings exposure, paper UI previews, and tests.

### Verification
```text
npx tsc --noEmit -> tsc_exit=0
npm test          -> 114/114 passed
npm run build     -> passed
curl /api/healthz -> HTTP 200
Railway worker logs -> active monitor/sync/trend/retention jobs through 2026-04-30
```

### Files Changed
- `AGENTS.md` — corrected instruction paths and framework version.
- `.claude/handoffs/2026-04-30-verification-handoff.md` — new install/deploy/ops handoff.
- `src/lib/paper-risk.ts` — spread-aware executable price helper and risk config.
- `src/lib/paper-fill.ts` — fills use executable price and seed short borrow rate.
- `src/lib/paper-exits.ts` — auto-exits use executable price semantics.
- `src/app/api/paper/*` and UI/settings files — expose cost metrics and spread setting.
- `src/lib/*test.ts` — execution-cost/risk test coverage.

## [2026-04-26 08:02] — feature: complete Grid Sweep strategy promotion workflow

**Area:** Trading/Research, Trading/Strategies
**Type:** feature
**Branch:** `master`

### Why
The initial Grid Sweep promotion slice created disabled paper strategies, but operators still needed duplicate safety and a dashboard-level way to inspect what was promoted, what is executable, and what research-only assumptions were preserved as warnings.

### What
- Added stable `promotion_key` generation for Grid Sweep promotion payloads.
- Made `/api/strategies/promote` idempotent for the same filters, trade settings, costs, and Grid row.
- Added promoted-strategy summaries to promotion responses.
- Extended `/api/strategies` with parsed executable config summaries and research provenance.
- Updated `/strategies` to display promoted Grid Sweep source, disabled status, setup details, grid stats, and warning details.
- Updated Grid Sweep success messaging for duplicate promotions.
- Added unit coverage for promotion keys and summaries.

### Verification
```text
npx tsc --noEmit → passed
npm test -- src/lib/strategy-promotion.test.ts → 5/5 passed
npm test → 109/109 passed
```

### Files Changed
- `src/lib/strategy-promotion.ts` — promotion key + readable summary helpers
- `src/app/api/strategies/promote/route.ts` — idempotent duplicate detection
- `src/app/api/strategies/route.ts` — config/provenance summaries in API response
- `src/app/strategies/page.tsx` — promoted strategy visibility and warnings
- `src/components/GridSweepSection.tsx` — duplicate-aware promotion success message
- `src/lib/strategy-promotion.test.ts` — key/summary coverage
- `.claude/sessions/2026-04-26-080200.md` — session notes

## [2026-04-23 07:59] — perf: matrix virtualization + /reversal API status split

**Area:** Trading/Reversal, Trading/Perf
**Type:** perf

### Files Changed
- `src/app/reversal/page.tsx` — `loadData(status)` + `fetchedStatus` cache + `Promise.allSettled` (PR #45). `flatRows` memo + `useVirtualizer` + padding-`<tr>` tbody refactor (PR #46).
- `package.json` — added `@tanstack/react-virtual ^3.13.24`.
- `.claude/sessions/2026-04-22-204857.md` — recovered orphaned `/log` notes from prior session.

### Functions/Symbols Modified
- `desiredStatusForView(v)` — new helper
- `loadData(status)` — modified to take slice param + cache sentinel + `Promise.allSettled`
- `flatRows`, `matrixScrollRef`, `rowVirtualizer`, `virtualItems`, `virtPaddingTop`, `virtPaddingBottom` — new for virtualization
- `FlatRow` discriminated union — new type

### Database Tables
- N/A (pure client optimizations; `/api/reversal` accepts `?status=` unchanged)

### Summary
User reported app felt resource-heavy. Ran `scripts/perf-probe.mjs` (deleted after) — `/reversal?view=matrix` clocked 66,883 DOM nodes, 3.4s longest main-thread task, 11.6s wall-load. Two PRs: (#45) wire client to fetch only the status slice the current view needs (was always fetching ~800KB union), and (#46) virtualize the 986-row matrix table via `@tanstack/react-virtual`. Post-deploy verification: matrix DOM 66,883 → 327 (−99.5%), longest task 3,391ms → 812ms (−76%), wall-load 11.6s → 4.4s (−62%). Orphaned `/log` session notes from prior session recovered in a chore commit within PR #45.

## [2026-04-22 20:48] — Session close: 10 PRs merged, 2 Codex reviews absorbed, 2 user-spotted UI bugs

**Area:** Trading/Multi (Paper, Research, Matrix, Surveillance, Settings, Docs)
**Type:** mixed (feature + bugfix + hotfix + audit + docs)

### Files Changed
Umbrella for 10 merged PRs today — per-PR entries below. PRs merged in this session: **#35** audit scripts, **#36** RED settings validation, **#37** matrix→paper batch modal, **#38** lazy whitelist sync, **#39** Grid Sweep Apply + leverage max, **#40** batch endpoint hardening (Codex-1 + Codex-2), **#41** deviation band + Codex-3 replay-quantity fix, **#42** empty-state headers + SYSTEM.md, **#43** NaN guards + defaults save surfacing, **#44** matrix default opacity.

### Functions/Symbols Modified
Summary reference — see per-PR entries below. Key new exports: `filterTradableSymbols`, `getLastCloseMap`, `checkFillPriceDeviation`, `ensureTradableSymbol`, `RiskSchema`, `BatchOrderSchema`, `ApplyGridRow`, `FILL_PRICE_DEVIATION_BAND`, `BatchTradeModal`.

### Database Tables
- `tradable_symbols` — backfilled from `reversal_entries` + ongoing lazy-insert + `LAZY_SYNC` marker (PR #38, #40)
- `paper_orders` — new `is_manual_fill TINYINT(1)` column + new batch-endpoint INSERT path + `client_request_id` idempotency (PR #37, #40)
- `paper_trades` — new INSERT path through `fillOrder` with arbitrary caller-price (PR #37)
- `app_settings (risk.*)` — tightened Zod validation bounds (PR #36)
- `paper_accounts` — verified atomic reset semantics (no schema change)

### Summary
Full-day marathon. Opened from a crashed prior session, unblocked with prod creds, ran headed audit, absorbed a parallel Claude Desktop audit (RED Finding #2 on commission input), shipped user-requested matrix→paper batch feature, discovered real matrix↔whitelist gap via live E2E, fixed at the root (lazy sync + backfill), closed out remaining Claude Desktop findings + Codex-1 + Codex-2 + Codex-3 in three tightly-scoped hotfix PRs, then two user-screenshot bug reports caught UI sloppiness (Trade History disappearing, matrix rendered washed-out grey) — both fixed same-day. Tests went 58 → 104. Railway auto-deployed each PR with healthz verified between. Added `.claude/SYSTEM.md` — 243-line manual — and updated `CLAUDE.md` session-start protocol to point future agents at it. Paper account reset to pristine ($100k) at end.

## [2026-04-22 20:00] — fix: batch price-deviation band + idempotent-replay quantity bug

**Area:** Trading/Paper
**Type:** fix + feature
**Branch:** `fix/batch-price-deviation-band`

Two things in one PR — both came out of follow-up review of PR #40:

### 1. Price-deviation band on batch fill (feature — closes Codex-1 "catastrophic success" interview)
Closes the one real risk in PR #37's design that PR #40 only marked with `is_manual_fill=1` but did not prevent:
without a sanity band, a caller could submit `fill_price=$1` for a $300 stock and the paper account
would silently print +$299/share of fake equity. The `is_manual_fill` flag helps analytics filter
these trades post-hoc, but doesn't stop the fantasy P&L in the first place.

Implementation:
- New pure helper `checkFillPriceDeviation(fillPrice, lastClose, band=0.2)` in `paper-risk.ts` —
  returns `ok: false` with a human-readable reason when `|fill − close| / close > band`. Fails
  open (ok=true) when lastClose is missing, so genuine data gaps don't break the batch flow.
- New bulk helper `getLastCloseMap(symbols[])` — one INNER JOIN on `(symbol, MAX(date))` to fetch
  the latest close per symbol in one round-trip (same N+1-avoidance pattern as `filterTradableSymbols`).
- Route wires both up-front, before the per-row loop. Rejects get rich reasons like
  `SYNTHETIC_DEVIATION_TOO_LARGE: fill_price $1.00 is 99.7% off last close $300.00 (max 20%)`.
- `FILL_PRICE_DEVIATION_BAND = 0.2` exported as a named constant; configurable via the helper arg
  if we later want to loosen it for specific symbol classes.
- +10 unit tests covering: exact edge (20%), both directions, the Codex scenario ($1 on $300),
  lastClose missing → pass-through, non-finite fillPrice → reject, custom band.

### 2. Idempotent-replay quantity bug (hotfix — Codex-3 finding)
PR #40's 1062-catch branch read `paper_orders.quantity` — but the batch path sizes by
`investment_usd` and never sets `quantity`, so every FILLED replay via the 1062-race returned
`quantity: 0`. The pre-check branch already did the right thing (LEFT JOIN paper_trades to pull
the real fill quantity); this change makes the 1062-catch SELECT identical to the pre-check
SELECT — both paths now return a `trade_quantity` value from `paper_trades.quantity`.

Documented with a comment that both replay paths MUST return identical payloads.

### Verification
```
npx tsc --noEmit → tsc_exit=0
npm test        → 104/104 passed (was 94; +10 deviation tests)
```

### Files Changed
- `src/lib/paper-risk.ts` — `checkFillPriceDeviation`, `getLastCloseMap`, `FILL_PRICE_DEVIATION_BAND`
- `src/lib/paper-risk-deviation.test.ts` — new, 10 tests
- `src/app/api/paper/batch-order/route.ts` — pre-fetch lastCloseMap, per-row deviation check,
  1062-catch SELECT fixed to JOIN paper_trades
- `.claude/agent-log.md` — this entry

### Post-deploy smoke
Live E2E on prod before this PR confirmed:
- `is_manual_fill` column landed via `ensureColumn` migration
- idempotency: same batch-id replay returned same trade_ids (10, 11) with `idempotent_replay: true`
- account reset back to pristine

## [2026-04-22 19:30] — hotfix: batch endpoint hardening (Codex-1 + Codex-2 review)

**Area:** Trading/Paper, Trading/Research
**Type:** hotfix (review remediation)
**Branch:** `fix/batch-endpoint-hardening`

Two independent critical reviews (Codex-1 agentic, Codex-2 manual code-read) landed after PR #39. Both flagged real issues. This hotfix closes the agreed set — 8 items across idempotency, perf, schema hygiene, and UX correctness.

### Items closed
- **I1 Idempotency** — `client_request_id` per item wired through Zod → INSERT → 1062-catch. LEFT JOIN paper_trades on replay to pull real fill quantity (paper_orders.quantity is NULL in batch path). Modal regenerates `batchId-${i}` on each open. +6 tests
- **I2 N+1 whitelist** — new `filterTradableSymbols(symbols[])` helper runs one `IN(...)` query. Batch route pre-checks up-front, fails fast with SYMBOL_NOT_TRADABLE or WHITELIST_UNAVAILABLE without any INSERTs
- **I4 BE→trailingActivate semantic lie** — `applyGridRowToForm` no longer writes `trailingActivateAtPct` from the grid row's `breakevenAtPct`. Preserves prior form value; tooltip updated to reflect
- **T1 Force STOP only when row has stops** — both reviewers flagged as UX bug. If all three bracket fields are null (pure hold-based row), `exit.kind` is now preserved instead of silently switched to STOP
- **T2 is_manual_fill provenance flag** — new `TINYINT(1) NOT NULL DEFAULT 0` column on `paper_orders` via `ensureColumn`. Batch inserts set `=1`. Closes "MARKET no longer means live-quote + RTH" blind spot; downstream analytics can filter synthetic fills out
- **T3 exchange='LAZY_SYNC' marker** — `ensureTradableSymbol` now writes `'LAZY_SYNC'` instead of `NULL`. Backfill SQL in migrations updated; retroactive `UPDATE tradable_symbols SET exchange='LAZY_SYNC' WHERE exchange IS NULL AND symbol IN (...)` handles rows written by the previous NULL version
- **T4 Zod trailing_stop_pct 20→50** — 20% was too tight for volatile penny/low-float names. Now 50% as typo-guard, not strategy policy. Client input `max` synced to 50 too. Boundary test updated
- **T5 Order-dependence contract documented** — JSDoc expanded with explicit "rows processed SEQUENTIALLY, each fill mutates cash before next row, reordering produces different results at buying-power edge" section. Plus "synthetic fill provenance" paragraph

### Items NOT fixed (verified false alarm or deferred)
- **I3 notes collision** — Codex-2 read `paper-fill.ts:887/945`: order notes copied into trade notes on fill, order row itself not overwritten. **False alarm**. No action
- All-or-nothing toggle, SRP refactor of ensureSchema, `origin_type` enum column, agent-log-format — deferred to backlog. Both reviewers agreed acceptable as-is for MVP

### Verification
```
npx tsc --noEmit → tsc_exit=0
npm test        → 94/94 passed (was 88 before this PR; +6 idempotency tests)
```

### Process note
The background agent (fullstack-nextjs-specialist) that started this work stalled mid-implementation on the idempotency LEFT JOIN detail (stream watchdog fired at 600s idle). Partial work was salvageable and correct — picked it up from working-tree, added the 5 extra items from Codex-2's review, and finished.

## [2026-04-22 18:40] — fix: Grid Sweep Apply-to-form + leverage max

**Area:** Trading/Research, Trading/Settings
**Type:** feature (Apply-to-form) + polish (leverage input max)
**Branch:** `fix/research-apply-and-leverage-max`

Closes two of the remaining items from the Claude Desktop headed audit:

### Finding #5 — Grid Sweep Apply-to-form (MEDIUM)
Grid Sweep in `/research` shows per-config P&L across ~10-1000 strategy variants and lets the user sort by totalPnl / winRate / sharpe / profitFactor. Previously the only way to take a promising row back to the single-run simulator was to manually retype its params into the "Параметры сделки" form above — friction that defeated the purpose of running the grid.

Fix:
- `GridSweepSection` takes a new optional prop `onApplyToForm?: (row: ApplyGridRow) => void`. When provided, each result row renders an "Apply" button in a new rightmost column.
- Click mirrors the row's exit params onto the form: `holdDays`, `hardStopPct`, `takeProfitPct`, `trailingStopPct`, and (semantic-closest) `breakevenAtPct` → `trailingActivateAtPct`. Forces `exit.kind='STOP'` so the stop/TP/trail fields become visible.
- Grid-only axes (`entryDelayDays`, `entryBar`, `exitBar`) are silently dropped — the single-run API doesn't expose them; those dimensions can only be explored in the Grid Sweep itself. Commented in code.
- Parent `/research/page.tsx` wires a ref on the "Параметры сделки" card and calls `scrollIntoView({ behavior: 'smooth' })` so the user sees the form change.
- Applied row renders an "Applied ✓" emerald badge for 2.5s before reverting to a button (so the same row can be re-applied if the user tinkers and wants to restore).

### Self-noted polish — leverage client-side max
`/settings` Defaults card: the `leverage` `<Input type="number">` had `min={1}` after PR #36 but no `max`. Server Zod already enforces `leverage: z.number().min(1).max(10)` — no validation gap, but the client input now mirrors the server bound (`max={10}`) so the browser itself constrains editing.

### Verification
```
npx tsc --noEmit → tsc_exit=0
npm test        → 88/88 passed (unchanged — this is pure UI wiring over existing types)
```

### Files Changed
- `src/components/GridSweepSection.tsx` — new `onApplyToForm` prop, Apply column + button + badge + 2.5s revert timer
- `src/app/research/page.tsx` — `tradeParamsCardRef`, `applyGridRowToForm()` handler, pass to `<GridSweepSection onApplyToForm={applyGridRowToForm}>`
- `src/app/settings/page.tsx` — `max={10}` on leverage input
- `.claude/agent-log.md` — this entry

### Not in this PR (deliberately skipped)
- Claude Desktop Finding #3 `/voice` no drag-drop zone — LOW, pure UX polish, native `<input type="file">` works fine as-is
- Finding #1 React hydration #418 — LOW, auto-recovers, root cause is SSR/client state timing in the matrix; untangling it is a bigger project than its impact warrants right now
- Phase 3 real-time minute polling — user earlier approved only Phase 1+2 for the matrix→paper feature

## [2026-04-22 18:10] — feat: lazy whitelist sync — closes matrix↔paper gap

**Area:** Trading/Paper, Trading/Surveillance
**Type:** feature + data fix
**Branch:** `feat/whitelist-lazy-sync`

### Why
Live E2E after PR #37 (matrix→paper batch modal) uncovered a real-but-known UX bug: `/reversal` matrix had 956 rows but the `tradable_symbols` whitelist only had 232 (the curated CSV seed). The first-row tickers I sampled for the E2E (NVTS, CAR, XNDU) were all legitimate NASDAQ/NYSE equities but absent from the seed — batch submit rejected all three with `SYMBOL_NOT_TRADABLE`. Root cause is an explicit MVP shortcut documented in `scripts/sync-tradable-symbols.ts` (live NASDAQ fetch "skipped for the MVP").

User ask: fix the root cause, not the UX.

### Fix (A + lazy)
1. **`ensureTradableSymbol(symbol)` helper** in `src/lib/paper-risk.ts`. `INSERT IGNORE` with `active=1, asset_class='EQUITY', exchange=NULL`. Best-effort (doesn't throw on DB glitch — enrollment is the canonical write).
2. **Lazy insert on enrollment** in both `surveillance-cron.ts` paths: after each `INSERT INTO reversal_entries` for MOVERS (line 644) and TREND (line 1868). Safe-by-construction: Yahoo's day_gainers / day_losers and the TREND scan only surface real US-listed equities.
3. **One-shot backfill in `ensureSchema`** — `INSERT IGNORE INTO tradable_symbols SELECT DISTINCT symbol, NULL, 'EQUITY', 1 FROM reversal_entries`. Runs once per server boot but is a ~no-op on subsequent boots thanks to the symbol-PK `INSERT IGNORE`. Closes the backlog of 956-232 = ~724 previously-enrolled symbols in one pass.

### Non-impact
- Curated CSV seed remains the "base" whitelist. `sync-tradable-symbols.ts` is unchanged.
- `isSymbolTradable` query is unchanged — still `active=1 AND asset_class='EQUITY'`. Lazy-added rows satisfy both.
- Other accounts / tables untouched.
- `exchange=NULL` on lazy-added rows distinguishes them from the curated seed (which has NASDAQ/NYSE). No query currently filters by exchange, but the provenance is there if we later want to distinguish.

### Verification
```
npx tsc --noEmit → tsc_exit=0
npm test        → 88/88 passed (unchanged test count; this PR adds no new tests — lazy-insert is INSERT IGNORE data-layer logic, exercised by the live E2E retest post-deploy)
```

Post-deploy plan: re-run the same direct batch POST that failed for NVTS/CAR/XNDU — expect 3/3 FILLED once Railway picks up the migration and backfills existing enrollments on first `ensureSchema` call.

### Files Changed
- `src/lib/paper-risk.ts` — new `ensureTradableSymbol` helper
- `src/lib/migrations.ts` — one-shot backfill from reversal_entries
- `scripts/surveillance-cron.ts` — call `ensureTradableSymbol` after each enrollment INSERT (MOVERS + TREND)
- `.claude/agent-log.md` — this entry

## [2026-04-22 17:10] — feat: matrix → paper-trade batch modal

**Area:** Trading/Matrix, Trading/Paper
**Type:** feature + tests
**Branch:** `feat/matrix-to-paper-batch`

### Why
User asked to close the research-execution gap: from the `/reversal` matrix, check N tickers, hit a CTA, open a modal with per-ticker side/qty/fill-price/stop%/trail%/TP%, submit → trades land in /paper with brackets already set. Previously the flow required retyping each symbol into /paper's single-order form — friction enough that it wasn't happening.

### Design choice log
- **Phase 1 scope**: Matrix CTA + modal + batch endpoint. Phase 2 (EOD stop-eval cron) turned out to already be covered by `jobMonitorPaperTrades` in `scripts/surveillance-cron.ts:2152` (15-minute RTH cadence, reuses `paper-exits.ts` + slippage parity from PR #33). No new cron written.
- **"Fill at yesterday's close" semantics**: /api/paper/order (single) gates MARKET orders by RTH + fetches live price, which breaks the "pretend I bought at matrix entry_price" mental model. The new batch endpoint DELIBERATELY bypasses both — it calls `fillOrder(pool, orderId, user_supplied_price)` directly. This is pure paper, so allowing an arbitrary fill price is the right move (noted in the route comment).
- **Partial-success semantics**: the batch does NOT abort on a single failed row. Each ticker's result is returned individually (filled / rejected / error). UI surfaces per-row status instead of "all or nothing" — matches how real retail order platforms handle multi-leg entries.
- **Default qty = floor($1000 / price)**: keeps user from accidentally submitting 1000× their intended exposure. Upper-bound caps on qty/price/pct mirror the PR #36 settings hardening.

### What shipped
1. **`POST /api/paper/batch-order?account_id=N`** (`src/app/api/paper/batch-order/route.ts`)
   - Accepts `{orders: [{symbol, side:LONG|SHORT, qty, fill_price, stop_loss_pct?, trailing_stop_pct?, take_profit_pct?}]}` (1..50 orders).
   - Per-order: whitelist check → INSERT paper_order as PENDING MARKET with bracket_*_pct fields → `fillOrder` at user-supplied price (no RTH gate, no live-price fetch).
   - Returns `{summary, results}` with per-row {status, reason?, order_id?, trade_id?}.
   - Zod schema exported so bounds are unit-tested.
2. **`BatchTradeModal`** (`src/components/paper/BatchTradeModal.tsx`)
   - Pre-fills `side` from `entry.direction`, `fillPrice` from `entry.entry_price`, `qty = floor($1000/price)`, stop=3%, trail=off, TP=off.
   - Live totals footer: notional, at-risk, estimated commission.
   - Per-row result column populated after submit; filled rows are read-only afterward (submit-remaining semantics).
3. **`/reversal` CTA wiring** (`src/app/reversal/page.tsx`)
   - Sticky indigo bar appears between the toolbar and the matrix when `selectedRowIds.size > 0`.
   - Click → opens `BatchTradeModal` with the selected entries resolved from the full `entries` list (so off-filter-but-still-checked rows are included).
   - On successful submit: clears selection (both F1 and F2) so a re-open doesn't resubmit.

### Tests
`src/app/api/paper/batch-order/schema.test.ts` — 13 tests pin bounds: symbol format, side enum, qty/fill_price positivity, upper-bound rejections, bracket percent ranges, batch size 1..50.

### Verification
```
npx tsc --noEmit → tsc_exit=0
npm test        → 88/88 passed (was 75 before this PR; +13 new batch schema tests)
```

### Files Changed
- `src/app/api/paper/batch-order/route.ts` — new endpoint + Zod schema
- `src/app/api/paper/batch-order/schema.test.ts` — new, 13 tests
- `src/components/paper/BatchTradeModal.tsx` — new modal
- `src/app/reversal/page.tsx` — import modal, add selection state, sticky CTA bar, modal render
- `.claude/agent-log.md` — this entry

### Not in this PR (phase 3 — optional)
Per-minute real-time polling outside the existing 15-min RTH cron. If the user later wants sub-15-minute stop triggering, options are: (A) tighten the existing cron to `*/1` during RTH (more Yahoo load), (B) move to Alpaca free IEX feed (free after signup, IEX-only ≈3% volume), (C) Polygon.io basic ($29/mo consolidated tape). User approved Phase 1+2 only for now.

## [2026-04-22 16:15] — RED Finding #2 fix: settings input validation

**Area:** Trading/Paper, Trading/API
**Type:** fix + tests
**Branch:** `fix/settings-input-validation`
**Severity of fixed bug:** RED (silent 1000× cost-model corruption)

### Why
Claude Desktop's parallel headed audit surfaced Finding #2 on `/settings`: typing `-5` into "Commission — per share ($)" caused the browser's `<input type="number">` to strip the `-`, parsing `5` into React state. Previous server Zod `commission_per_share: z.number().min(0).max(10)` accepted this as valid — silently persisting $5/share (1000× the default $0.005). Any backtest or paper fill running on that config would compute catastrophically wrong P&L until a human noticed.

### Fix — multi-layer defense
1. **Tightened server Zod bounds** (`src/app/api/paper/settings/route.ts`). New upper limits reject obviously-wrong retail values while leaving headroom for illiquid edges:
   - `commission_per_share`: 10 → 0.5 (max $0.50/share; retail brokers cap near $0.02)
   - `commission_min_per_leg`: 100 → 10
   - `slippage_bps`: 500 → 200
   - `default_borrow_rate_pct`: 200 → 100
   - `RiskSchema` now `export`ed so unit tests can pin the bounds.
2. **HTML-level guardrails** on the risk-model inputs (`src/app/settings/page.tsx`). Added `min` + `max` to `<Input type="number">` for every field — browsers with `min=0` refuse to let the user type `-`, closing the specific `-5 → 5` sanitization hole. Also added `min={0}` (and `min={1}` for leverage) to the legacy Defaults card for the same class of bug.
3. **Pre-save client validation** — `validateRisk()` mirrors the server bounds and refuses to POST when a field falls outside, showing the exact label + range + actual value inline.
4. **Server error surfacing** — on non-OK response, parse `issues[0]` from the Zod reply and show `Invalid input — <path>: <message>` instead of a generic "Failed to save."
5. **Status coloring** — `riskMessage === "Saved."` renders emerald, anything else (i.e. any error) renders rose. Previously both were `text-zinc-500` gray and visually indistinguishable.

### Tests
New file `src/app/api/paper/settings/schema.test.ts` (6 tests) pins:
- accepts defaults
- accepts partial patches (each field optional)
- REJECTS `commission_per_share = 5` (the Finding #2 value)
- REJECTS any negative on each numeric field
- REJECTS each field's new upper bound + 1
- ACCEPTS each field's new upper bound exactly (boundary pinning)

### Verification
```
npx tsc --noEmit → tsc_exit=0
npm test        → 75/75 passed (previously 69/69; +6 new bounds tests)
```

### Files Changed
- `src/app/api/paper/settings/route.ts` — tighten Zod bounds + `export` the schema
- `src/app/settings/page.tsx` — client validation + `min`/`max` on all numeric inputs + status color
- `src/app/api/paper/settings/schema.test.ts` — new, 6 tests
- `.claude/agent-log.md` — this entry

## [2026-04-22 15:00] — Dashboard-stats stay-put probe (closes Finding #1)

**Area:** Trading/QA
**Type:** audit follow-up (no code change in src/)
**Branch:** `chore/prod-audit-2026-04-22` (same PR #35, new commit)

Ran `scripts/prod-audit-dashboard.mjs` to disambiguate Finding #1 from the 14:45 entry. Method: log in, land on `/`, sit for 10s, record `/api/reversal` + `/api/runs` completion + any console errors.

Result:
```
requests-fired=2
reversal-done=200
runs-done=200
network-failed=0
dashboard-stats-errors=0
total-console-errors=0
```

Verdict: Finding #1 closed as a test-walker artifact. No production code change needed. Session notes updated in place.

### Files Changed
- `scripts/prod-audit-dashboard.mjs` — new, stay-put dashboard probe
- `.claude/sessions/2026-04-22-headed-audit.md` — Finding #1 marked RESOLVED with the 10s-stay-put verification block
- `.claude/agent-log.md` — this entry

## [2026-04-22 14:45] — Headed prod audit (post PR #34)

**Area:** Trading/QA
**Type:** audit (no code change in src/)
**Branch:** `chore/prod-audit-2026-04-22`
**Session notes:** `.claude/sessions/2026-04-22-headed-audit.md`

### Scope
Continuation of the crashed session that ended at the "ADMIN_PASSWORD or Claude Desktop" fork. User unblocked with credentials; I ran headed Playwright locally.

### What ran
Two scripts added to the repo for reuse:
- `scripts/prod-audit.mjs` — 12-route walk + 5 targeted probes (matrix basics, PR #34 empty-cache refetch, PR #33 auto-exit slippage, paper-filter mutation, scenarios tab switch).
- `scripts/prod-audit-matrix.mjs` — focused second pass on `/reversal?view=matrix` with correct selectors + correct `/api/prices?symbol=...` filter.

Artifacts (gitignored): `audit/prod-audit/report.json` + 19 screenshots; `audit/prod-audit-matrix/report.json` + 3 screenshots.

### Result
- 12/12 routes HTTP 200, 0 hard failures, 0 `pageerror` on navigation except a known React #418 hydration on `/reversal?view=matrix` that auto-recovers (already documented in `.claude/sessions/2026-04-22-qa-findings.md`).
- Matrix renders 986 rows, 956 ticker buttons clickable; popover click opens and triggers `GET /api/prices?symbol=NVTS&limit=90` with non-empty response; re-open correctly hits cache (0 refetch).
- 1 YELLOW on `/` — `console.error: Dashboard stats error TypeError: Failed to fetch` from `src/app/page.tsx:48-70`. Not a known user-facing bug; looks like an in-flight fetch aborted when my audit script navigated away too fast (only one arm of the `Promise.all([fetch("/api/reversal"), fetch("/api/runs")])` completed in the network log). Marked as suspected test artifact, not a production defect.

### Coverage gaps documented in the report
- PR #34 empty-response refetch could not be exercised on this snapshot (NVTS returns non-empty; fix is covered by the unit test added in `d76d13f`).
- PR #33 auto-exit slippage could not be exercised because the prod paper account has zero closed trades with `HARD_STOP`/`TRAILING_STOP`; fix is covered by 10 unit tests in `src/lib/paper-exits.test.ts` (commit `02034c8`).
- PR #29 orchestration probes (TREND `prices_daily` backfill timing, Best/Worst duplicate-symbol click) not attempted — they would need fresh-enrollment fixtures and more refined selectors respectively.

### Mutations + rollback
Two safe mutations (scenarios tab #2 → tab #1 view switch). Both reverted. No writes to DB, no orders, no accounts, no resets.

### Verdict
Ship. No RED findings.

### Files Changed
- `scripts/prod-audit.mjs` — new
- `scripts/prod-audit-matrix.mjs` — new
- `.claude/sessions/2026-04-22-headed-audit.md` — full findings + rollback log + product judgment
- `.claude/agent-log.md` — this entry

(`audit/` is already in `.gitignore`, so the raw screenshots + report.json are not committed; the session notes summarize them.)

### Verification (exit-code discipline)
```
node scripts/prod-audit.mjs → exit 0  (12/12 pages 200, 0 pageerror, 1 warning)
node scripts/prod-audit-matrix.mjs → exit 0  (matrix renders, popover fetches prices, cache hit on reopen)
```

## [2026-04-22 13:50] — Codex 2nd-pass: cache + encoding + tsc errata

**Area:** Trading/Matrix, Trading/Verification, Trading/Docs
**Type:** fix + errata

Codex reviewed the 2026-04-22 session output and surfaced three findings. All three are fair — addressing here.

### Errata (Must) — false "tsc clean" claim in PR #32 entry
The `## [2026-04-22 13:30]` log entry for PR #32 / commit `cab7905` claims `npx tsc --noEmit: clean`. That was wrong at that checkpoint: `src/lib/paper-exits.test.ts` used the regex `/s` (dotAll) flag, which requires ES2018+, while `tsconfig.json:2` targets ES2017. TSC emits `TS1501` on that. I missed it because my verification command was `tail -10` of tsc output, which truncated the error, and I did not check the exit code. The error actually surfaced only in PR #33 when I re-ran tsc after adding more tests — I fixed it in commit `02034c8` by replacing `.*` + `/s` with `[\s\S]*`.

Per this log's immutable-entry policy I do not rewrite the old entry. This entry is the official correction. Process discipline for future sessions: always check `tsc_exit=$?`, never trust `tail -N` output.

### Should fix — PriceChartPopover cached empty responses
Codex caught that `priceCache.set(entry.symbol, items)` ran unconditionally, so an empty response (e.g. popover opened seconds before the TREND auto-backfill from PR #29 actually populated `prices_daily`) would stick as `[]` until a full page reload. Worse, the RTL test that "verified" cache reuse implicitly locked that regression in. Both fixed on branch `fix/codex-critique-tsc-cache-encoding`:
- Component now only caches non-empty results; reads use `hasMeaningfulCache` check.
- New test `does NOT cache empty responses — re-opens the popover triggers a fresh fetch` proves empty → refetch.

### Should fix — BRK.B encoding test was a no-op
`encodeURIComponent("BRK.B")` returns `"BRK.B"` unchanged, so the test would pass even if the encoding were removed. Replaced with `"AT&T"` (encodes to `"AT%26T"`) — the one case where missing encoding would actively break the URL (the raw `&` would terminate the `symbol` param). Assertions now check both the encoded form is present AND the raw form is absent.

### Files Changed
- `src/components/charts/PriceChartPopover.tsx` — cache guard + explanatory comments
- `src/components/charts/PriceChartPopover.test.tsx` — new empty-cache test; rewrote encoding test
- `.claude/agent-log.md` — this entry

### Verification (done with exit-code discipline this time)
```
npx tsc --noEmit; echo "tsc_exit=$?"
tsc_exit=0
npm test → 69/69 passed
```

## [2026-04-22 13:45] — Finding #3 (HIGH/MEDIUM): auto-exit slippage parity

**Area:** Trading/Paper
**Type:** fix + tests
**Branch:** `fix/auto-exit-slippage-parity`
**Commit:** `02034c8`
**PR:** [#33](https://github.com/filippmiller/trading/pull/33) (merged `08c7e31`)

### Why
Internal-critic 2026-04-21 Finding #3 (and the side-effect of Finding #2 before its 2026-04-21 hotfix): `applyExitDecisionToTrade` used the raw trigger price for proceeds / pnl_usd / sell_price. The manual-close path in `paper-fill.ts` applies slippage via `applySlippage` to the same columns. Net effect: LONG positions auto-exited at hard/trailing stops kept slightly more cash than a user manually closing at the same quote; SHORT covers kept slightly less pain. Over many stop-triggered exits this systematically inflated realized cash vs a real portfolio. Also the `slippage_usd` accumulator column was not charged on auto-exit rows — the conservation invariant (commission_usd + slippage_usd subtracted from ledger) was under-counting cost.

### What changed
New pure helper `computeExitFillPrice(reason, side, triggerPrice, cfg)` in `src/lib/paper-exits.ts`:
- HARD_STOP / TRAILING_STOP / TIME_EXIT / LIQUIDATED → MARKET fill after trigger. LONG closes via SELL (price nudged down by `slippageBps`); SHORT covers via BUY (price nudged up).
- TAKE_PROFIT → LIMIT resting at target. Filled at trigger, no slippage.

`applyExitDecisionToTrade` now uses `exitFillPrice` where it previously used `currentPrice`, accumulates `slippage_usd` in the UPDATE, and stores `sell_price = exitFillPrice`. Type-check remains clean (`slippage_usd` is existing DECIMAL column).

### Tests (10 new, 68 total)
- LONG: each of HARD_STOP / TRAILING_STOP / TIME_EXIT / LIQUIDATED yields fillPrice < trigger
- LONG + TAKE_PROFIT: fillPrice = trigger
- SHORT: HARD_STOP / TRAILING_STOP yields fillPrice > trigger
- SHORT + TAKE_PROFIT: fillPrice = trigger
- slippageBps=0 config: fillPrice = trigger on every (reason, side) combo
- Symmetry: LONG and SHORT adjustments are equal-magnitude, opposite-sign

### Verification
- npm test: 68/68 passed (from 58 before this PR)
- npx tsc --noEmit: clean
- Prod healthz: 200 (pre-merge), 200 (post-merge)

### Note on Finding #2 (HIGH, commission asymmetry)
Already fixed by the 2026-04-21 "Bug #2" hotfix (paper-exits.ts:376-385). `applyCommission` runs on auto-exits and `netCredit` subtracts `closeCommissionUsd` for LONG, accumulates onto `commission_usd`. Confirmed by direct file read before starting this PR — no action needed.

### Files Changed
- `src/lib/paper-exits.ts` — +62 (new helper, import tweak, `exitFillPrice` plumbing, slippage_usd in UPDATE)
- `src/lib/paper-exits.test.ts` — +80 (computeExitFillPrice test block)

## [2026-04-22 13:30] — Post-PR-29 follow-ups: cleanup + component extraction + 2 MEDIUM critic fixes

**Area:** Trading/Repo-hygiene, Trading/Matrix, Trading/Paper
**Type:** chore + refactor + fix
**Branches / PRs:**
- `chore/root-cleanup` → [#30](https://github.com/filippmiller/trading/pull/30) (merged `0f7aee1`)
- `refactor/extract-price-chart-popover` → [#31](https://github.com/filippmiller/trading/pull/31) (merged `1087e37`)
- `fix/paper-watermark-txn-and-float-literal` → [#32](https://github.com/filippmiller/trading/pull/32) (merged `568b7d3`)

### PR #30 — repo hygiene
Root had ~108 PNG screenshots (only 3 tracked: `debug-reversal.png`, `reversal-page-production.png`, `reversal-v2-demo.png`), 2 zero-byte typo files (`0`, `=`), a stale backfill-summary JSON, a yahoo probe dump, and `.tmp/` / `test-results/` / orphan `.claude/worktrees/` artifact dirs. `git status` was unusable. `.gitignore` hardened with catch-alls: `/*.png`, `/*.jpeg`, `/*.jpg`, `/backfill-*.json`, `/yahoo-*.json`, `/.tmp/`, `/test-results/`, `/.claude/worktrees/`. 8 `.claude/sessions/*.md` notes (2026-04-17 → 2026-04-22) committed so future sessions can recover context. Orphan worktree `.claude/worktrees/agent-aa7c4ebe` pruned — its branch `feat/paper-w4-risk-model` (@ `d0f2fb7`) remains intact.

### PR #31 — PriceChartPopover extraction + RTL coverage
`src/app/reversal/page.tsx` was 2052 lines with `PriceChartPopover` and its module-level `priceCache` inlined at line 391. Untestable without extract. Moved to `src/components/charts/PriceChartPopover.tsx` (~270 lines). Kept module cache + exposed `_resetPriceCacheForTests()` for vitest. Added `data-testid` + `aria-label` hooks. Page shrinks 2052 → 1798 lines (−254). 9 new RTL tests: loading placeholder, empty state, HTTP 500 error, out-of-window amber warning, happy-path candle rendering, backdrop-click close, inner-click no-close (stopPropagation), × button close, cache-reuse on remount, URL encoding.

### PR #32 — 2 MEDIUM paper-trading correctness fixes
**Finding #1 (internal-critic 2026-04-21)**: watermark UPDATE in `jobMonitorPaperTradesImpl` ran outside a transaction, racing with fillOrder cover. Fix: gate watermark persistence on `result.reason == null` (exit path writes watermarks atomically inside `applyExitDecisionToTrade`). Replaced inline UPDATE with `persistWatermarks` helper from `paper-exits.ts`; extended that helper's signature to accept `null` for max/min PnL (early-tick state).

**Finding #10**: `WHERE ... closed_quantity + ? <= quantity + 1e-9` partial-close guard in `paper-fill.ts` used a scientific-notation float epsilon against DECIMAL(18,6) columns — fixed-point in MySQL, not IEEE-754, so tolerance was false safety. Dropped `+ 1e-9` from SQL. JS-side tolerance on line 666 (`willBeFullyClosed`) kept — JS numbers ARE float.

3 new unit tests on `persistWatermarks` (SQL shape, null-tolerance, boolean→TINYINT mapping).

### Test suite growth across the day
- Start of day: 0 tests (repo had no test infra)
- After PR #29: 46 tests (vitest infra + scenario math + PnL)
- After PR #31: 55 tests (+ PriceChartPopover RTL)
- After PR #32: 58 tests (+ persistWatermarks contract)

### Verification
- `npm test` after each PR: green (46 → 55 → 58 passing)
- `npx tsc --noEmit`: clean after every change
- Prod `https://trading-production-06fe.up.railway.app/api/healthz`: 200 (pre- and post-merge smoke)

### Open follow-ups (deliberately deferred)
- Codex finding #1 (TREND enrollment auto-backfill) was shipped in PR #29 but verification in prod requires a fresh TREND scan — after next `jobScanTrends` tick, confirm TREND enrollments show `prices_daily` rows.
- Internal-critic Finding #2 (HIGH) — LONG auto-exit commission asymmetry, Finding #3 (MEDIUM) — SHORT auto-exit slippage. Out of scope for this batch; worth a dedicated PR with smoke-test around `applyExitDecisionToTrade` cash accounting.
- Finding #11 (isSymbolTradable silent DB errors) — already partially handled by PR #20 (`whitelist-503`). Verify no other silent-catch sites remain.

## [2026-04-22 12:12] — Vitest coverage + Codex findings #1 & #2 fix

**Area:** Trading/Tests, Trading/Matrix, Trading/Surveillance
**Type:** test infra + bug fix
**Branch:** `test/matrix-coverage`
**Commit:** `ec6263a`
**PR:** [#29](https://github.com/filippmiller/trading/pull/29)

### Why this session
Session was accidentally closed mid-work. Recovered from `.claude/sessions/2026-04-22-qa-findings.md` + reflog: user was resuming the single open debt from PR #28 critique (Should #3 — "no tests for new UI components"), had already installed vitest + RTL + happy-dom in `package.json` but not yet committed or configured. While setting up tests, user surfaced two fresh Codex findings against the merged PR #28 deploy — both real bugs, both addressed in the same PR.

### Files Changed
- `vitest.config.ts` — new (happy-dom, `@/` alias, setup file)
- `src/test/setup.ts` — new (`jest-dom` + per-test cleanup)
- `package.json` + `package-lock.json` — add vitest 4.1.5, happy-dom 20.9, @testing-library/{react,jest-dom,user-event}, @vitejs/plugin-react; add `test`/`test:watch`/`test:ci` scripts
- `src/lib/matrix-scenarios.test.ts` — new, 26 tests (SCENARIOS, computeStreak, resolveDirection, evaluateScenario, summarizeScenario, computeRecurrences, compareAllScenarios; includes regression test on Codex finding #2)
- `src/lib/reversal.test.ts` — new, 10 tests (calculateEntryPnL LONG/SHORT/leverage/costs/daysHeld/null-safety)
- `src/lib/matrix-scenarios.ts` — add optional `entryId` + `cohortDate` on `ScenarioTickerInput`, thread through `PerTickerResult` and `ScenarioReport.best/worst` (Codex finding #2)
- `src/app/reversal/page.tsx` — `entryToScenarioInput` populates the new fields; Best/Worst click handlers look up by `entryId` with symbol fallback
- `scripts/surveillance-cron.ts` — `jobScanTrends` collects `enrolledSymbols[]` and runs `refreshSymbolData` best-effort backfill loop with 400ms throttle after the scan, mirroring `jobEnrollMovers` (Codex finding #1)

### Functions/Symbols Modified
- `ScenarioTickerInput`, `PerTickerResult`, `ScenarioReport.best/worst` — added optional id+cohortDate fields
- `summarizeScenario` — `cand` now carries `entryId`/`cohortDate`
- `entryToScenarioInput` — populates id+cohortDate
- `jobScanTrends` — post-insert prices_daily backfill loop

### Database Tables
- Read-only access during scenario evaluation. TREND path triggers additional writes to `prices_daily` (via `refreshSymbolData`) after each TREND insert into `reversal_entries`.

### Verification
- `npm test`: **46/46 passed** in 1.84s
- `npx tsc --noEmit`: clean
- Prod healthz `trading-production-06fe.up.railway.app`: 200 OK (smoke check pre-merge)

### Open follow-ups
- CI check on PR #29 (GitHub API was timing out at push time — verify run status when API recovers)
- After merge: manually verify fresh TREND enrollment gets `prices_daily` rows populated; verify Best/Worst click on duplicate-symbol scenario opens the exact enrollment
- Eslint on `src/app/reversal/page.tsx` is still red from pre-existing issues (Codex noted same) — separate cleanup task, out of scope for this PR

## [2026-04-21 11:40] — Railway production deploy + auth retrospective log + prod smoke

**Area:** Trading/Ops, Trading/Auth, Trading/Infra, Trading/Verification
**Type:** docs (retroactive) + verification
**Commit documented:** `fe6bccc` (feat: add Railway production deploy and app auth, 2026-04-21 07:17 UTC+3)
**Prod URL:** https://trading-production-06fe.up.railway.app

### Why this retroactive entry
`fe6bccc` shipped the Railway production infrastructure but did not include an agent-log entry. The subsequent data-restore entry (`f9f343a` / PR #10) documents the VPS → Railway data move but not the underlying deploy. This entry closes that gap and records the end-to-end prod verification done today via Playwright.

### What `fe6bccc` introduced
- `Dockerfile` (multi-stage Next.js standalone) + `Dockerfile.worker` (tsx-runtime scheduler)
- `docker/init-db.sql` — bootstrap schema for Railway MySQL first-start
- `middleware.ts` — session-cookie auth gate; public paths: `/login`, `/api/auth/login|logout`, `/api/healthz`; everything else redirects to `/login?next=…`
- `src/app/login/*` + `src/app/api/auth/{login,logout,me}/route.ts` + `src/lib/auth/{constants,password,server,session}.ts` — admin-only login backed by `SESSION_SECRET`
- `src/lib/bootstrap.ts` + `src/lib/migrations.ts` — first-boot admin provisioning from `ADMIN_EMAIL` / `ADMIN_PASSWORD` env
- `src/app/api/healthz/route.ts` — `{ ok: true, service: "web" }`
- `scripts/surveillance-cron.ts` — updated to accept Railway-style `MYSQL*` envs in addition to `MYSQL_*`
- `docs/RAILWAY.md` — 3-service deploy plan (`web` + `worker` + `MySQL`)

### Railway topology (confirmed today)
| Service | Railway name | Latest deploy | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| Web (Next.js) | `trading` | 2026-04-21T04:19Z | SUCCESS |
| Scheduler | `worker` | 2026-04-21T04:19Z | SUCCESS |
| Database | `MySQL` | 2026-02-04T15:07Z | SUCCESS |

Note: docs in `docs/RAILWAY.md` call the web service `web`, but the actual Railway service name is `trading`. Not worth renaming — just documenting the drift here.

### Verification (prod smoke via Playwright, 2026-04-21)
Added `scripts/prod-smoke.mjs` — logs in with `ADMIN_EMAIL` / `ADMIN_PASSWORD` and walks the seven user-facing routes, capturing screenshots and console errors.

| Route | HTTP | Rendered heading | Console errs |
|---|---:|---|---:|
| `/api/healthz` | 200 | `{"ok":true,"service":"web"}` | — |
| `/` (dashboard) | 200 | "Mean reversion research, automation, and paper execution" | 1 ⚠ |
| `/reversal` | 200 | "Surveillance Command" — 491 tickers, $70.72 P&L, 46.5% WR | 0 |
| `/research` | 200 | "Strategy Research" | 0 |
| `/paper` | 200 | "Paper Trading Simulator" | 0 |

Matrix tab on `/reversal`: 1 table, 922 rows, "All 891 / Gainers 553 / Losers 338" — row counts match the post-restore target (`reversal_entries=891`) exactly. 2026-04-20 cohort renders 134 tickers. Full D1–D10 morning/midday/close column grid intact.

### Known issue surfaced by the smoke
`/` dashboard logs one console error: `Dashboard stats error: TypeError: Failed to fetch` (client-side fetch in a SSR-hydrated dashboard widget). Page still renders; not a blocker for this verification, but a follow-up candidate. Not introduced by `fe6bccc` — likely pre-existing behavior now visible because the dashboard is in a logged-in production context for the first time.

### Files Changed (this entry)
- `.claude/agent-log.md` — this entry
- `scripts/prod-smoke.mjs` — new; reusable Playwright smoke against any SMOKE_BASE

### Database Tables
- Read-only via the app — no schema or data changes in this pass.

## [2026-04-21 09:18] — Railway data restore from VPS (matrix recovery)

**Area:** Trading/Ops, Trading/Data, Trading/Docs
**Type:** data recovery + docs
**Branch:** `ops/railway-data-restore`
**Commit:** `f9f343a`
**PR:** [#10](https://github.com/filippmiller/trading/pull/10)
**Session notes:** [2026-04-21-091800-railway-data-restore.md](sessions/2026-04-21-091800-railway-data-restore.md)

### Files Changed
- `scripts/railway-restore-prelude.sql` — new, FK-safe TRUNCATE prelude for 8 VPS-owned tables before mysqldump load
- `.claude/deploy-instructions.md` — full restore playbook, two-DB topology, verification queries
- `CLAUDE.md` — session-start report updated to reflect Railway production deploy target
- `.claude/agent-log.md` — this entry
- `.claude/sessions/2026-04-21-091800-railway-data-restore.md` — detailed session notes

### Functions/Symbols Modified
- N/A — no application code touched. Ops-only change (SQL + docs).

### Database Tables Affected (Railway production MySQL)
Restored from VPS (TRUNCATE + INSERT preserving PKs for FK integrity):
- `reversal_entries` 134 → **891**
- `paper_signals` 63 → **3,023**
- `paper_position_prices` 0 → **18,283**
- `paper_trades` 0 → **3**
- `paper_orders` 0 → **7**
- `surveillance_logs` 9 → **69**
- `surveillance_failures` 0 → **192**
- `paper_strategies` 32 → **32** (synced `enabled` flags from VPS)

Preserved on Railway (not touched):
- `prices_daily` (9,374 rows, 1989-2026 seed history)
- `strategy_runs` / `trades` / `run_metrics` (5 / 65 / 5 research runs)
- `app_users` (admin), `app_settings`, `paper_accounts`

### Summary
Root cause: the 2026-04-20/21 Railway deploy bootstrapped the production DB empty and did not migrate the VPS-side accumulating dataset. User reported the "matrix of tickers with prices" had disappeared. Verified both DBs were reachable (VPS via SSH + local tunnel on 3319, Railway via public TCP proxy), row-counted every table on both sides, confirmed `paper_strategies` IDs matched 1:1 (no FK remap needed), confirmed VPS's 2026-04-20 symbol set was identical to Railway's (zero today-only Railway enrollments would be lost by overwrite). Executed a surgical restore: 8 VPS-owned tables TRUNCATEd + reloaded from `mysqldump --no-create-info`, 4 Railway-owned tables left alone. Post-restore row counts match plan exactly; FK integrity clean.

### Verification
- Row counts on Railway match VPS dump exactly for all 8 restored tables
- FK integrity clean: `paper_position_prices` → `paper_signals` (0 orphans), `surveillance_failures` → `reversal_entries` (0 orphans), `paper_signals.strategy_id` → `paper_strategies.id` (0 orphans)
- The 69 `paper_signals.reversal_entry_id` orphans on Railway post-restore are pre-existing on VPS (verified same count on source); that column has no actual FK constraint defined, only an index
- Matrix date range on Railway now spans 2026-03-10 → 2026-04-20 (29 trading days, 486 unique symbols, D1-D10 captures intact)

### Gotchas
- Docker Desktop for Windows has broken internal DNS for Railway proxy hostnames. Workaround in playbook: resolve host on laptop via `nslookup switchback.proxy.rlwy.net 8.8.8.8`, pass the IP to `docker run ... mysql -h <ip>`.
- Railway DB is called `railway` not `trading`. Use `mysqldump --no-create-info --tables <list>` (not `--databases`) to produce a DB-neutral dump.
- Worker service is stateless over DB content, so no worker restart was required after the restore.

## [2026-04-20 11:15] — Recovery, docs refresh, PR #8 merge, merged-state verification

**Area:** Trading/Ops, Trading/Docs, Trading/Git, Trading/Verification
**Type:** maintenance + merge + docs

### Files Changed
- `.claude/agent-log.md` — added this entry
- `.claude/deploy-instructions.md` — rewritten to reflect tunnel-based local operation and current verification workflow
- `docs/FEATURES.md` — rewritten from obsolete voice-simulator framing to current trading research platform
- `.claude/sessions/2026-04-20-111500.md` — new session record

### Functions/Symbols Modified
- N/A — no application code changed in this pass beyond merging the already-reviewed PR #8 branch into `master`

### Database Tables
- None

### Summary
Picked up from a crashed session after Grid Sweep had already been merged into remote `master`. Reconstructed state from the screenshot plus `.claude` session notes, restored the SSH DB tunnel, and verified merged `master` by hitting `/research` and `/api/research/grid`. Then rebased `fix/tab-audit-critical-cleanup` onto current `master`, force-pushed the rebased branch, created a clean integration worktree, and merged PR #8 into `master`.

Also refreshed the two stale docs that were materially out of date:
- deployment notes were still pinned to 2026-04-09 and did not mention the SSH tunnel or Grid Sweep verification path
- feature documentation still described the product as a voice strategy simulator instead of the current multi-page trading research + paper execution app

### Verification
- confirmed `origin/master` already contained Grid Sweep merge (`f6e3cd7`)
- restored tunnel on local `3319`
- verified `/research` returned `200`
- verified `/api/research/grid` returned valid JSON once DB connectivity was restored
- rebased PR #8 with one expected conflict in `.claude/agent-log.md` only
- post-merge build verification remains subject to Google Fonts reachability during `next build`

### Commits
- `f6e3cd7` — existing Grid Sweep merge on `master`
- `0fb0c20` — rebased `fix/tab-audit-critical-cleanup`
- integration `master` now includes PR #8 merge after this pass

### Session Notes
- `.claude/sessions/2026-04-20-111500.md`

## [2026-04-19 14:00] — Grid Sweep: multi-dimensional strategy search on /research

**Area:** Trading/Research, Trading/UI, Trading/API
**Type:** feat (strategy research primitive)

### Files Changed
- `src/lib/scenario-simulator.ts` — `ExitStrategy` gains `exitBar` + `breakevenAtPct`; `TradeParams` gains `entryDelayDays` + `entryBar`; `evaluateExitWalk` now walks all 3 bars/day (30 ticks over 10 days) with a `startDay` param for entry-delay support; new `runGridSweep` expands axis cross-product in-memory against a single DB load
- `src/app/api/research/grid/route.ts` — **new** POST endpoint with 10,000-combo hard cap
- `src/components/GridSweepSection.tsx` — **new** self-contained UI (5 presets, advanced axis editor, sortable top-25 results table)
- `src/app/research/page.tsx` — integrates `<GridSweepSection />` above the existing 1-D Parameter Sweep
- `scripts/analyze-delayed-entry.ts`, `analyze-momentum-carry.ts`, `analyze-strategy-grid.ts` — **new** CLI probes that surfaced the hypotheses the UI now automates

### Database Tables
- `reversal_entries` — read-only usage; selects all 30 bar columns (d1..d10 × morning/midday/close) instead of the previous 10 close columns

### Summary
Pre-existing `/research` page could run ONE scenario at a time, so finding the winning config across hold-days × exit-time × entry-delay × hard-stop × take-profit × trailing-stop × breakeven meant hours of manual scenario edits. The Grid Sweep primitive collapses that to one button click:

- User picks a preset (or edits axis values manually).
- Endpoint loads matching rows once, replays each combo in-memory.
- Returns top-25 configs sorted by the chosen metric.

Smoke numbers on 271-entry MOVERS gainers sample: 48-combo sweep runs in 1.4s. Top config — `hold=5d · exit=morning · trail=15%` — delivers **64% WR / +$5,687 / +21% avg per trade** at 5× leverage, vs the previous "hold 10 days close-exit" baseline of +$70 total.

Engineering choices:
- **In-memory replay over separate SQL queries** — one SELECT hydrates ~400 rows with all 30 bar columns (~100KB), each combo's simulation is pure arithmetic → ~30ms/combo regardless of DB state.
- **`startDay` param on `evaluateExitWalk`** — threads the entry-delay state through without duplicating the walk logic.
- **Hard 10k-combo cap** — prevents UI/server from combinatorial explosion (e.g. full 8-axis cross-product of 5 values each = 390k).
- **Breakeven arm as a first-class exit** — common real-world stop that wasn't expressible with hard_stop+trail alone.

### Verification
- `npx tsc --noEmit`: clean
- Backend smoke: `curl POST /api/research/grid` with 48 combos returns 200 in 1.4s
- UI smoke: Basic-hold-×-exit preset click → top-12 table renders with emerald highlight on winner
- Manual test of all 5 presets: each returns valid sorted output

### Commits
- (pending merge) — `feat/grid-sweep-strategy-search` branch, PR #9

### Open follow-ups (deliberately deferred)
- **Apply-to-form from grid row** — click a result row → populate main scenario form for drill-down with full trade list
- **Concentration filter** — cap max N occurrences of a single ticker (XNDU appeared 4× in top results, skewing stats)
- **ATR-based stops** — requires per-symbol volatility column
- **Regime filter** — requires SPY/VIX daily join (enable "skip trading when SPY red"-type filters)
- **Pair trades** (LONG top-5 + SHORT bottom-5) — structural second leg, not a simple axis
- **Vol-adjusted sizing** — needs historical vol per symbol

## [2026-04-19 07:00] — Full tab audit + 11 fixes (header lies, silent failures, stale KPIs, HTML nesting)

**Area:** Trading/UI (all 11 tabs), Trading/Cron (auto-close), Trading/DB (PnL backfill)
**Type:** critical-cleanup + data backfill

### Files Changed
- `src/components/AppShell.tsx` — live NYSE phase detection (Open/Pre/After/Closed); clock is mount-only to fix hydration mismatch; "Strategy Auto: 09:50 ET" → "Enroll: 16:05 ET"
- `src/components/TickerDownloader.tsx` — **new**, inline ticker-download affordance replacing 3 dead "Add one on the Dashboard first" references
- `src/components/ScenariosSection.tsx` — tri-state preview (`spec` / `error` / `notReady`) replacing misleading "Invalid parameters" default; `<CardDescription>` wrapping `<div>` fixed (was HTML-nesting hydration error); inline downloader integrated
- `src/app/page.tsx` — stale "Next sync window starts at 09:45 AM ET" → corrected "09:45 ET price-sync · 16:05 ET post-close MOVERS enrollment"
- `src/app/strategies/page.tsx` — `h1` "Strategy Scenarios" → "Strategy Dashboard" (was colliding with /scenarios); silent `catch {}` → visible error-state + retry
- `src/app/settings/page.tsx` — silent "Loading..." forever → try/catch + error+retry + proper loading UI
- `src/app/markets/page.tsx` — flat 60s refresh → market-phase-aware cadence (30s open, 90s pre/after, paused closed)
- `src/app/prices/page.tsx`, `src/app/voice/page.tsx` — inline `TickerDownloader` integration; `loadSymbols` promoted to returned-promise for downloader callback
- `src/lib/data.ts` — `loadPrices` mysql2 LIMIT prepared-statement bug (`ECONNREFUSED`-looking 500 on `/api/prices`) → `pool.query` with inlined int
- `src/lib/surveillance.ts` — 14-day auto-close now computes `final_pnl_usd`/`final_pnl_pct` in the same UPDATE via direction-adjusted CASE (was only flipping status, leaving PnL NULL forever)
- `scripts/backfill-completed-pnl.ts` — **new** one-time backfill for 400 COMPLETED entries with NULL PnL
- `docker/docker-compose.override.yml` — **new**, local-dev port remap (3320 → 3319) to match existing `.env.local`
- `package.json` — `@playwright/test` 1.58.1 → 1.59.1
- `.gitignore` — audit screenshots, `.claude/shots/`, `docker/.env`

### Database Tables
- `reversal_entries` — 400 COMPLETED rows backfilled with `final_pnl_usd`/`final_pnl_pct` via direction-adjusted close-to-entry on latest available d-close. Post-backfill: **186 wins / 213 losses / 1 scratch = 46.5% win rate, +$70.72 total PnL, avg +0.177% per trade**. Before: all 400 had `final_pnl_usd=NULL` → Overview and Reversal KPIs read $0 / 0% forever.

### Summary
Comprehensive critical audit across all 11 tabs (Overview, Markets, Mean Reversion, Strategy Dashboard, Strategy Scenarios, Strategy Research, Market Signals, Price Surveillance, Voice Intelligence, Simulation Runs, Paper Trading, System Settings). Initial visible symptoms were mostly "empty / broken" — root cause analysis revealed two underlying issues masquerading as many:

1. **SSH tunnel (3319→VPS 3320) had dropped** during the audit → every API endpoint started returning 500, every page's silent `catch {}` swallowed the error and rendered empty state ("$0", "0 strategies", "No entries"). Restoring the tunnel fixed the visible symptoms; adding loud error-state + retry pattern prevents regressions.

2. **User-facing trust lies** hardcoded in the shell — "Market Live" pulsing green on Sunday 01:00, "Strategy Auto: 09:50 ET" reflecting a schedule that was moved to 16:05 on 2026-04-18. Replaced with live market-phase detection and accurate cron schedule.

3. **Stale `final_pnl_usd=NULL` on 400 COMPLETED entries** — auto-close path only flipped status, never computed PnL. Both paths now fixed: one-off backfill script + forward-looking SQL CASE in `syncActiveSurveillance`.

4. **Minor HTML-validity issue** — `<CardDescription>` (renders as `<p>`) wrapping `<div>` nested-element children caused one persistent hydration warning; replaced with plain styled `<div>`.

### Verification
- All 11 tabs screenshotted pre/post-fix — visual confirmation for each
- Final cross-tab console sweep: **0 errors, 0 warnings, 0 hydration mismatches** across all 11 pages (previously 21+ errors total)
- `backfill-completed-pnl.ts` dry-run followed by apply: 400/400 rows updated, 0 skipped
- Overview KPI confirmed: "Win Rate 46.5%" (was 0.0%), "Strategy Win Rate 46.5%" (was 0.0%)
- `/api/prices?symbol=SPY&limit=5` now 200 (was 500 `Incorrect arguments to mysqld_stmt_execute`)
- Playwright 1.59.1 upgrade verified via one full navigation loop

### Deploy
Not deployed — local-dev only. Changes merged via PR after push.

### Open follow-ups (not in this PR)
- **TREND cohort pollution in matrix** — user spotted during commit that cohort sizes vary wildly (13/23/124/38 vs expected 20/day). Root cause: `enrollment_source='TREND'` adds streak-based rows alongside the strict top-10/top-10 `MOVERS`. Proposed next PR: matrix filter defaulting to MOVERS-only with opt-in "Show TREND" toggle; separate decision on whether TREND cron stays alive.
- `.claude/deploy-instructions.md` "Last Verified: 2026-04-09" — stale, should be refreshed.
- `docker/.env.example` has `MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=changeme` while `.env.local` uses `trading123` — alignment when someone audits secrets.

### Commits
- (pending) — `fix/tab-audit-critical-cleanup` branch, PR to follow

## [2026-04-18 21:10] — Move MOVERS enrollment 09:45 AM → 16:05 ET (post-close)

**Area:** Trading/Cron, Trading/Data migration
**Type:** refactor (semantic shift) + data backfill

### Files Changed
- `scripts/surveillance-cron.ts` — jobEnrollMovers guard 09:45→16:05; runFullSync split into runMorningSync + runCloseSync; cron schedule updated; startup catchup no longer enrolls
- `scripts/backfill-movers-post-close.ts` — **new** one-time migration script

### Database Tables
- `reversal_entries` — 540 rows updated (entry_price → daily close, day_change_pct → close-to-close full day)
- `reversal_entries_backup_20260418` — **new** safety backup of 560 MOVERS rows pre-backfill

### Summary
После обсуждения с user обнаружено семантическое несоответствие: пользователь ожидал enrollment **post-close** (акции закрывшиеся сильно вверх/вниз за день), но код enrolls в 09:45 AM — это overnight gap + первые 15 мин. Часто такие утренние движения = продолжение вчерашнего news-driven move, не независимый сегодняшний сигнал.

**Два изменения в одном потоке:**

1. **Cron refactor**: enrollment moved to 16:05 ET, runFullSync split, startup catchup no longer enrolls. Deployed to VPS (container Up 17s, schedule log показывает новый taim). Первый реальный post-close enrollment — понедельник 2026-04-20 16:05 ET.

2. **Backfill existing data**: 540 MOVERS entries обновлены:
   - entry_price = daily close вместо 09:45 AM price
   - day_change_pct = full day close-to-close вместо overnight+15min
   - d1..d10 columns НЕ трогались (они уже правильные)
   - Safety backup в `reversal_entries_backup_20260418` (560 rows)
   - Restore query задокументирован в backup table

**Эффект на данные:**
- 18 entries где direction=SHORT но close went DOWN (gap-and-fade)
- 21 entry где direction=LONG но close went UP (gap-and-rally)
- Т.е. ~7% существующих entries имеют semantic mismatch — 9:45 сигнал оказался шумом
- Остальные 93% consistent с ожидаемым направлением

**Пример AAOI 2026-04-09:**
- Было: entry $132.70, day_change +12.8% (overnight gap + ранний spike)
- Стало: entry $133.30, day_change **+0.5%** (real full-day close-to-close)
- Т.е. акция открылась с +12% gap, но за день полностью вернулась ближе к flat. Оригинальный 9:45 сигнал это чистый шум.

### Verification
- Code: tsc clean, eslint clean, deployed to VPS
- Data: 540 rows updated, 0 misses, backup table verified (560 rows)
- Direction consistency: 93% entries consistent (521/560)

### Deploy
- Cron container rebuilt via GitHub raw pull (SCP failed due to VPS memory pressure — 12GB swap used)
- Startup log confirms new schedule: "09:45 — Morning price sync — no enrollment", "16:05 — ... + ENROLL today's post-close movers"

### Commits
- `85a7f6c` — refactor(cron): move MOVERS enrollment 09:45 AM → 16:05 ET (#7)

### Follow-up
- Re-run /research на обновлённых данных — пересчитать edge numbers (вероятно edges станут чётче без noise от 9:45 entries)
- Решить что делать с 39 direction-mismatch entries (можно добавить flag в UI /research для фильтра)

## [2026-04-18 01:15] — Strategy Research polish: Sharpe, histogram, presets, CSV, persistence

**Area:** Trading/Research, Trading/UI
**Type:** feat (autonomous v2 polish)

### Files Changed
- `src/lib/scenario-simulator.ts` — ScenarioSummary extended with profitFactor, sharpeRatio, medianPnlUsd, avgHoldDays, exitReasonCounts, pnlHistogram (12 buckets)
- `src/app/research/page.tsx` — 4 quick preset buttons, localStorage persistence, advanced metrics row, exit reason stacked bar, PnL histogram SVG, CSV export

### Summary
Autonomous polish pass per пользовательской инструкции «сделай сам всё что можешь». Six polish features shipped in one PR:

1. **Quick presets** — 4 кнопки из data-driven analysis (Baseline UP, Monster Rider, Dip Bounce, Gainer Fade контр-пример). Один клик → filters + trade params заполняются.
2. **Form persistence** — localStorage key `research:lastForm`. Refresh страницы не теряет форму.
3. **Reset to defaults** — кнопка сбрасывает в безопасные дефолты.
4. **Advanced metrics** — profit factor, Sharpe ratio (annualized по sqrt(252/avgHoldDays)), MaxDD, costs breakdown. Colour-coded thresholds.
5. **Exit reason breakdown** — горизонтальный stacked bar показывающий proportion TIME/HARD_STOP/TAKE_PROFIT/TRAIL_STOP/DATA_MISSING.
6. **PnL histogram** — pure SVG 12-bucket распределение P&L % по сделкам. Отрицательные бины красные, положительные зелёные.
7. **Export CSV** — download всех сделок в CSV с timestamp в filename.

All additive — `/api/research/run` shape обратно-совместимый (новые поля добавлены, существующие без изменений).

### Verification
- `npx tsc --noEmit`: clean
- `npx eslint`: clean
- `npm run build`: PASSES

### Commits
- `32126cf` — feat(research): polish — Sharpe, histogram, presets, CSV export, persistence (#6)

## [2026-04-18 00:45] — Strategy Research — интерактивный проигрыватель сценариев

**Area:** Trading/Research, Trading/UI, Trading/API, Trading/Schema
**Type:** feat (4-phase feature shipped in one PR)

### Files Changed
- `src/lib/scenario-simulator.ts` — **new** core simulator (runScenario with direction-aware exits, equity curve)
- `src/app/api/research/run/route.ts` — **new** POST run endpoint
- `src/app/api/research/scenarios/route.ts` — **new** save/list endpoints (upsert by name)
- `src/app/api/research/scenarios/[id]/route.ts` — **new** DELETE endpoint
- `src/app/api/research/sweep/route.ts` — **new** parameter sweep endpoint (8 dims)
- `src/app/research/page.tsx` — **new** UI page with form + table + SVG equity curve + sweep
- `docker/init-db.sql` + `src/lib/migrations.ts` — new `paper_scenarios` table
- `src/components/AppShell.tsx` — added "Strategy Research" nav entry
- `scripts/backtest-strategies.ts` — bundled live-pair collision fix (missed in PR #3 merge)
- `.claude/sessions/2026-04-17-data-driven-strategy-research.md` — **new** analysis log

### Database Tables
- `paper_scenarios` — **new** (id, name UNIQUE, description, filters_json, trade_json, costs_json, last_result_summary_json, created_at, updated_at). Created automatically on first API hit via ensureSchema.

### Summary
Built Strategy Research — интерактивный "what-if" playground на странице `/research`. Пользователь задаёт фильтры (cohort period, UP/DOWN, magnitude, streak, source), параметры сделки (investment, leverage, LONG/SHORT, exit strategy), издержки (commission, margin APY) и получает: таблицу симулированных сделок, сводку (win rate, ROI, best/worst, MaxDD), SVG equity curve график.

4 фазы всё в одном PR (пользователь сказал "гони до конца"):

1. **Phase 1** — core simulator + базовая форма с таблицей результатов
2. **Phase 2** — 4 типа exits (TIME, HARD_STOP, TAKE_PROFIT, TRAIL_STOP), direction-aware walk через d1..dN, leverage liquidation, SVG equity curve
3. **Phase 3** — сохранение/загрузка сценариев (upsert по name, chips с last-PnL индикатором)
4. **Phase 4** — parameter sweep: автоматический перебор одного параметра (holdDays, leverage, investmentUsd, day-change range, hard stop, take profit, trailing), таблица с 🏆 best highlighted

Переиспользует direction-aware `computePnL` из `strategy-engine.ts` (fixed в PR #3). Read-only — не пишет в live paper_signals / paper_accounts. Только в новую таблицу paper_scenarios для сохранения настроек.

### Context (зачем это сделано)
Предыдущие сессии нашли:
- SHORT стратегии стабильно убыточны (4/4 gap-stops day 1 live)
- Asymmetric market behavior: UP streaks продолжаются (75-90%), DOWN streaks отскакивают (82-86%)
- Friday 2026-04-10 симуляция: 10 UP movers × $100 × 5x = +$619 за 4 дня

Пользователь попросил инструмент чтобы исследовать эти гипотезы интерактивно без написания node-скриптов. `/research` — это именно он.

### Verification
- `npx tsc --noEmit`: clean
- `npx eslint`: clean
- `npm run build`: PASSES, все routes зарегистрированы:
  - `/research` (static page)
  - `/api/research/run`, `/api/research/scenarios`, `/api/research/scenarios/[id]`, `/api/research/sweep` (dynamic)
- paper_scenarios table будет создана автоматически при первом API hit (ensureSchema)

## [2026-04-17 23:55] — Internal Review + Adversarial Critic (5 follow-up fixes + dupe-key recovery)

**Area:** Trading/Cron, Trading/API, Trading/Schema, Trading/Lib
**Type:** bugfix (review-pass follow-up)

### Files Changed
- `docker/init-db.sql` — UNIQUE KEY UX_signal_strat_entry on paper_signals(strategy_id, reversal_entry_id)
- `scripts/migration-2026-04-17-unique-signal.sql` — **new** idempotent migration (APPLIED to prod)
- `src/lib/surveillance.ts` — ET-safe d-column iteration (same P0-4 fix as cron) + corrected MARKET_HOLIDAYS list + ET-explicit DATE_SUB
- `src/lib/strategy-engine.ts` — direction-aware PositionState, evaluateExit, computePnL
- `scripts/backtest-strategies.ts` — direction-aware inline exit loop + direction-aware maxPnlPct/minPnlPct watermarks
- `src/lib/migrations.ts` — memoized schemaReadyPromise to run ensureSchema() once per process
- `scripts/surveillance-cron.ts` — errno 1062 graceful recovery in both executor functions

### Database Tables
- `paper_signals` — **UX_signal_strat_entry** UNIQUE KEY added with idempotent migration (APPLIED LIVE, 0 duplicate collapses needed)

### Summary
Dispatched two independent review passes against the 19-fix PR #2:
1. **Reviewer** (code-reviewer subagent) — confirmed all P0 fixes correct-as-written except for one gap: the dup-check SELECT runs OUTSIDE the P0-2 transaction, so the constraint should be enforced at the DB level. Also flagged CONVERT_TZ dependency on mysql tz tables for future fresh containers.
2. **Critic** (bug-hunter subagent, adversarial) — found 21 NEW findings in files the first audit missed. Dominant classes:
   - **4× auth/trust boundary**: mutating API routes are unauthenticated (deferred — web app not publicly deployed yet)
   - **3× direction-aware math outside the cron**: strategy-engine + backtest were entirely LONG-only, every SHORT backtest silently inverted
   - **1× same TZ bug in HTTP path**: src/lib/surveillance.ts had identical P0-4 code the cron had
   - **1× state inconsistency**: paper_trades vs paper_signals split (deferred)
   - **1× ensureSchema per-request**: metadata lock contention risk

Shipped 4 correctness fixes as PR #3 + a follow-up dupe-key graceful-recovery fix as PR #4. Both squash-merged to master. The UNIQUE KEY migration was applied live to prod MySQL; the cron container was rebuilt and redeployed on VPS with the new errno 1062 handler. All other constraints (FK cascade on paper_position_prices from earlier, plus pre-existing UXs) verified still live via information_schema query.

Deferred (out of scope for live trading safety; web app not publicly deployed):
- Auth on mutating API routes (5 findings)
- Voice route rate-limits + LLM prompt-injection hardening
- /api/paper double-click race
- /api/reversal pagination
- Yahoo timeout helpers in src/lib (only /api/surveillance/sync would benefit)
- paper_trades/paper_signals equity union (UI display)

Prod-state changes this session:
- **UX_signal_strat_entry migration applied**: verified via `information_schema.STATISTICS`
- **Cron rebuilt and redeployed**: container came up clean in 11s, startup catchup completed, "Waiting for scheduled jobs..." reached
- **Monday's 09:50 ET tick now hardened**: any rare UNIQUE KEY race will rollback cash + skip candidate instead of aborting the whole tick

### Commits (merged to master)
- `1d407c8` — fix: second-pass review + adversarial-critic findings (4 fixes) (#3)
- `44a4a90` — fix(cron): graceful recovery from UNIQUE KEY race (errno 1062) (#4)

- All reads/writes unchanged structurally; timestamp comparisons now ET-explicit via `CONVERT_TZ`

### Summary
Comprehensive fresh-eye audit of the live trading cron (deployed Thu 4/16) against the previous model's work. Bug-hunter subagent produced 20 findings across 6 P0 / 10 P1 / 4 P2. All 6 P0s and all 10 P1s implemented; 3 of 4 P2s implemented (P2-4 style-only, consciously deferred).

Shipped as PR #2 in 6 commits on `fix/p0-trading-cron-safety`, squash-merged to master as commit 498d253. Code deployed to VPS via scp + `docker compose build` of the surveillance-cron container. Container came up cleanly in 22s; startup catchup completed in ~38s with no errors; "Waiting for scheduled jobs..." reached.

Two notable side-discoveries during the audit:
1. The holiday list had **two data bugs** — 2027 Good Friday was 3 weeks wrong (Apr 16 instead of Mar 26, which is actually 2028's date) and both 2026 and 2027 were missing Juneteenth entirely. These would have silently affected trading-day detection on 3 real dates.
2. The P0-3 fix unlocked **164 TREND entries** previously invisible to TRADING strategies — the scanner had been running daily but its output was never consumed by the trading path (only by CONFIRMATION strategies). Monday's 09:50 ET tick will see these as fresh candidates for the first time, capped by per-strategy `max_new_per_day=3` / `max_concurrent=15`.

Also the P0-6 fix measurably corrected inflated equity on prod: 2 strategies showed $13.09 of phantom SHORT-gap-up "gains" that are now accurately accounted for.

Prod-state changes this session:
- **FK migration applied** via `scripts/migration-2026-04-17-fk-cascade.sql` (0 orphan rows cleaned, CASCADE now enforced).
- **Cron container rebuilt** with new code; verified via startup log (`Retention prune (>30d paper_position_prices, daily)` schedule line proves new code is running).
- **All smoke tests re-ran green** post-deploy: schema ok, transaction path ok, 264-entry cohort window, 84 open signals direction-split (79 LONG / 5 SHORT), 0 orphan signals, ET date arithmetic, SHORT-aware SQL all validated.

Files on VPS (post-deploy):
- `/opt/trading-surveillance/scripts/surveillance-cron.ts` (new)
- `/opt/trading-surveillance/scripts/trend-universe.json` (unchanged)
- `/opt/trading-surveillance/docker/Dockerfile.cron` (unchanged)
- `/opt/trading-surveillance/docker/docker-compose.surveillance.yml` (unchanged)
- `/opt/trading-surveillance/docker/init-db.sql` (new — FK cascade)

## [2026-04-17 06:27] — First Live Trading Day Results Monitoring

**Area:** Trading/Analysis, Trading/Monitoring
**Type:** docs (monitoring, no code changes)

### Files Changed
No files changed — live monitoring and results review.

### Functions/Symbols Modified
N/A

### Database Tables
- `paper_signals` — Read-only: queried trading results
- `reversal_entries` — Read-only: verified enrollment state

### Summary
First live trading day (Thursday 4/16) verified after pipeline fixes. Pre-market guard correctly blocked stale enrollment. 9:45 AM MOVERS enrollment fired cleanly (20 tickers). QLYS banked +$1,535.73 (trailing stop at 10x = +96%). Confirmation strategies lost -$111.68 — 4/4 SHORT positions (Gainer Fade) gap-stopped at market open due to overnight tech rally (+$49.69 worst on PSKY). SHORT exit logic proven working correctly. 5 positions still open. Net realized: +$1,424. Gap risk identified as key tuning concern for leveraged SHORT strategies.

## [2026-04-16 11:26] — Trend Scanner + Confirmation Strategies + Cascade Bug Fixes

**Area:** Trading/Cron, Trading/Strategies, Trading/Analysis
**Type:** feature + bugfix (7 bugs across 3 review rounds)

### Files Changed
- `scripts/surveillance-cron.ts` — Added jobExecuteConfirmationStrategies, jobScanTrends, direction-aware jobMonitorPositions, pre-market guards, lastBar.date cohort logic, 8s fetch timeout
- `scripts/setup-confirmation-strategies.sql` — Created: 5 CONFIRMATION strategies ($5K each, $100/trade, 5x leverage)
- `scripts/setup-trend-strategies.sql` — Created: 3 TREND-based CONFIRMATION strategies
- `scripts/trend-universe.json` — Created: 517 liquid US symbols for trend scanner
- `scripts/smoke-test-confirmation.js` — Created: 83-check pipeline verification
- `scripts/smoke-test-trend.js` — Created: 75-check trend pipeline verification
- `scripts/cleanup-stale-2026-04-16.sql` — Created: cascade bug cleanup (refund cash, cancel signals, delete stale entries)
- `docker/Dockerfile.cron` — Added COPY for trend-universe.json
- `docker/init-db.sql` — Added direction column to paper_signals, enrollment_source column to reversal_entries
- `src/app/strategies/page.tsx` — Added "Confirmation only" scope filter

### Functions/Symbols Modified
- `jobExecuteConfirmationStrategies()` — new: d1/d2 confirmation-based entry engine
- `jobScanTrends()` — new: scans 517-symbol universe for 3+ consecutive day streaks
- `jobMonitorPositions()` — rewrote: direction-aware PnL, trailing stops, watermarks for SHORT
- `jobEnrollMovers()` — modified: added pre-market guard (skip before 9:45 AM ET), source-filtered idempotency
- `fetchDailyBars()` — modified: added AbortController with 8s timeout

### Database Tables
- `paper_signals` — Added direction column, backfilled 55 SHORT signals
- `reversal_entries` — Added enrollment_source column (MOVERS/TREND)
- `paper_strategies` + `paper_accounts` — 8 new strategies, cash refunded for cleanup

### Summary
Built confirmation strategy engine (waits for d1/d2 price confirmation before entry) with 5 initial strategies based on statistical analysis showing 90%+ win rates on "double confirmation" patterns. Expanded trading universe beyond Yahoo's top 20 movers by adding a trend scanner that detects 3+ day directional streaks in 517 liquid US stocks, with 3 trend-specific strategies. Two rounds of code review found 7 bugs (SHORT PnL inversion, missing direction column, cron race, no fetch timeout, source-blind idempotency, flat-day streak handling, market-hours guard). Third ultrathink self-review uncovered the most severe: a cascade bug where pre-market container startup enrolled 164 stale entries and placed 69 paper_signals, which would have silently blocked Thursday's entire MOVERS enrollment via idempotency. Fixed with cohort_date=lastBar.date logic + pre-market time guards + cleanup SQL. Pipeline verified ready for tomorrow's 9:45/16:15/16:30 ET triggers.

## [2026-04-16 08:11] — Reversal Trading Statistical Analysis: Finding >70% Probability Edges

**Area:** Trading/Analysis, Trading/Cron
**Type:** docs (research & analysis)

### Files Changed
- `scripts/trend-analysis.js` — Created: 3-day streak reversal analysis
- `scripts/trend-analysis-d2.js` — Created: Day 2 direction change analysis
- `scripts/mega-analysis.js` — Created: 500-line comprehensive analysis testing 4,684 filter combinations

### Functions/Symbols Modified
- No production code modified — analysis scripts only

### Database Tables
- `reversal_entries` — Read-only: queried all 520 entries with d1-d10 price columns
- `surveillance_logs` — Read-only: verified cron execution history

### Summary
Verified production cron is healthy (all 5 daily jobs firing correctly on VPS). Then conducted a deep statistical analysis of reversal trading data across 520 entries (2026-03-10 to 2026-04-15). Tested 4,684 scenarios combining type, magnitude, day-1 pattern, day-2 pattern, entry timing, and exit day. Found **790 scenarios with ≥70% win rate**. The #1 discovery: "Double Confirmation Bounce" — when a top loser bounces on d1 AND d2, it continues at **88-100% win rate** through d3-d5 with avg returns of 6-12% and max drawdown of only -1%. The 8-12% drop magnitude bucket showed the strongest reversal signal (75.8% by d5). LONG (buying losers) vastly outperforms SHORT (fading gainers). Close entry beats morning entry by 3-5%.

## [2026-04-10 05:00] — Code Review + Critic: 5 Fixes Applied, Clean Pass

**Area:** Trading/Strategy, Trading/Paper
**Type:** bugfix

### Files Changed
- `src/lib/paper.ts` — Concurrency limit on fetchLivePrices (batch of 5), non-recursive getDefaultAccount, renamed shadowed tradeRows variable
- `src/lib/strategy-engine.ts` — Trailing stop high watermark fix using Math.max, division-by-zero guard in computePnL
- `scripts/backtest-strategies.ts` — let→const lint fix

### Functions/Symbols Modified
- `fetchLivePrices()` — modified (concurrency limit: batches of 5)
- `getDefaultAccount()` — modified (non-recursive, throws on failure)
- `evaluateExit()` — modified (trailing stop uses Math.max for effective high)
- `computePnL()` — modified (entryPrice <= 0 guard)
- `fillOrder()` — modified (renamed shadowed tradeRows → openTradeRows)

### Database Tables
- N/A

### Summary
Ran /review on all session work, found and fixed 5 issues: unbounded parallel Yahoo fetches (now batched at 5), recursive getDefaultAccount without guard (now non-recursive with throw), trailing stop not considering current price as potential new high (now uses Math.max), division-by-zero in computePnL (now guards entryPrice <= 0), and variable shadowing in fillOrder SELL branch (renamed). Ran /critic after — clean pass, 0 new issues. All verified: TSC 0 errors, lint 0 issues on session files, Next.js build passes.

## [2026-04-10 04:30] — Strategy Scenario Engine: 24 Parallel Strategies + Backtest Results

**Area:** Trading/Strategy, Trading/Paper
**Type:** feature

### Files Changed
- `src/lib/strategy-engine.ts` — **New** — Config-driven entry/exit evaluation, P&L computation, 8 strategy templates × 3 leverages
- `src/lib/migrations.ts` — Added paper_strategies, paper_signals, paper_position_prices tables
- `scripts/seed-strategies.ts` — **New** — Seeds 24 strategies with dedicated $100k accounts
- `scripts/backtest-strategies.ts` — **New** — Runs all strategies against 420 historical entries, outputs ranking table

### Functions/Symbols Modified
- `matchesEntry()`, `evaluateExit()`, `computePnL()` — new in strategy-engine.ts
- `STRATEGY_TEMPLATES`, `LEVERAGE_TIERS`, `generateAllStrategies()` — new
- Types: `EntryConfig`, `SizingConfig`, `ExitConfig`, `StrategyConfig`, `ReversalCandidate`, `PositionState`, `ExitDecision`

### Database Tables
- `paper_strategies` — Created + seeded with 24 entries (8 templates × 3 leverage tiers)
- `paper_signals` — Created, populated by backtest with BACKTEST_WIN/BACKTEST_LOSS records
- `paper_position_prices` — Created (for future high-frequency position tracking)

### Summary
Built the Strategy Scenario Engine — a config-driven framework for running 24 trading strategies in parallel. Each strategy has its own $100k account and JSON config defining entry criteria, position sizing, and exit rules. Ran backtest against 420 historical reversal entries (21 cohort days). Key finding: **only 2 strategies are profitable** — Baseline 3D (hold 3 days, +$284 at 1x, +$2,901 at 10x, 54.3% win rate) and Big Drop (≥10% drops, +$430 at 1x, +$4,855 at 10x, 50% win rate). ALL trailing stop strategies LOSE money on mean reversion because the price dips first before recovering. Simple time-based exit outperforms all complex exit rules.

Major multi-phase session. Unified VPS MySQL as single source of truth (cron + web app were on separate DBs). Ran 5-agent critic review and fixed 12 issues including a critical calendar-day vs trading-day loop bug. Signed up for 3 data providers via Playwright (Twelve Data works, Finnhub and FMP both gate historical intraday behind paid tiers). Discovered Yahoo's unadvertised `?interval=5m&range=60d` endpoint and rewrote fetchIntradayPrice with symbol-level caching (30× fewer API calls, 1G container memory). Built full paper trading simulator (accounts, orders, cash, matching engine) after verifying via Playwright that Alpaca and Tradier both block Canadians. Fixed enrollment idempotency bug that caused April 8 cohort to balloon to 66 tickers (each container restart fetched different Yahoo top 10). All verified: cron is running, filled 59/60 April 8 cohort d1 prices (98.3%, 1 gap is Yahoo data quirk), idempotency working ("SKIP: already enrolled" logged), paper trading buy/sell flow works end-to-end.

### Summary
Started by investigating the surveillance cron built April 7-8. Discovered the VPS cron and local web app used separate MySQL databases. Unified them (VPS as single source of truth), created SSH tunnel script, backfilled 1 month of S&P 500 data directly into VPS. Ran 5-agent critic review, found and fixed 12 issues (critical trading-day loop bug, SQL injection defense, input validation, schema alignment, auth guard, market holidays, LIMIT 500, deploy hardening). Deployed and verified with Playwright showing 226 active tickers in matrix.

Researched alternative intraday data providers to replace Yahoo. Signed up for 3 services: Twelve Data, Finnhub, FMP. Discovered that **only Twelve Data includes historical 5-min bars in its free tier** — Finnhub and FMP both stripped this from free tiers in 2024-2025. Integrated Twelve Data as fallback, but hit 800/day quota after one sync attempt (massive backlog from backfilled midday cells).

Then discovered Yahoo's unadvertised `?interval=5m&range=60d` endpoint returns **60 trading days of 5-min bars in a single call** (4,681 bars for AAPL). Rewrote fetchIntradayPrice with symbol-level caching: 1 Yahoo call per unique symbol per sync, then instant in-memory lookups for all d1-d10 cells. Added memory optimization (filter to target time windows only), bumped container memory 256M→1G with NODE_OPTIONS heap, and added a Twelve Data circuit breaker. Verified: sync completes in 4:25 for 86 active entries.

Also researched paper trading APIs. Earlier research falsely claimed Alpaca paper-only worked from Canada; verified directly by visiting signup form and confirmed **Canada is blocked at the country dropdown** (list includes Comoros, Congo, China, Cyprus, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador — but NOT Canada). The app already has paper trading built-in via `paper_trades` table and `/api/paper/route.ts` — decided to extend that rather than chase external APIs.

### Data Provider Research (documented here for future reference)

**Tested and confirmed working for historical 5-min bars on free tier:**

| Provider | Historical Intraday | Limit | Notes |
|----------|:-------------------:|:-----:|-------|
| **Yahoo Finance** (unofficial) | **60 trading days** | Rate-limited (no hard cap) | Best free source. Single call returns all 60 days. Use `?interval=5m&range=60d`. |
| **Twelve Data** | 1+ month | 800 credits/day | Second best. 1 credit per symbol per call. Resets at UTC midnight. Grow plan $66/mo = unlimited. |

**Tested and confirmed DOES NOT work for historical intraday on free tier (2026):**

| Provider | Signed Up? | Historical Intraday Free? | What IS Free |
|----------|:---:|:---:|---|
| **Finnhub** | Yes (key: `d7bmg59r01qo9pqu6pcgd7bmg59r01qo9pqu6pd0`) | No — `/stock/candle` returns `"You don't have access to this resource"` | Real-time quote only, 60 calls/min |
| **FMP** | Yes (key: `WPaPEeBQd8mMXe8d7rjnDzupF9wGWY61`) | No — `/stable/historical-chart/5min` returns "Restricted Endpoint" | Real-time quote + EOD daily, 250 calls/day |
| **Alpha Vantage** | No | No — `TIME_SERIES_INTRADAY` with `month=` is premium-only | 25 calls/day daily-only |
| **Polygon.io** | No | No — EOD aggregates only on Stocks Basic free | Confirmed by staff forum post |
| **EODHD** | No | No — EOD only free, intraday at $29.99/mo | — |
| **Marketstack** | No | No — sub-15min intervals require Professional $99/mo | — |
| **Tiingo** | No | IEX intraday with 2000-bar rolling window (~7 days) | Not useful for >1 week history |

**Paper trading APIs (Canada accessible, with or without KYC):**

| Service | Paper Trading | Canada OK | Signup Friction |
|---------|:---:|:---:|---|
| **Alpaca Paper-Only** | Yes, full API | **NO — Canada blocked at signup dropdown** (confirmed 2026-04-09) | N/A |
| **Tradier Sandbox** | Yes, 15-min delayed | Yes (dev sandbox) | Email only |
| **IBKR Paper** | Yes (US securities only from Canada) | Yes | Full KYC + fund live account first |
| **Moomoo OpenAPI** | Yes | Yes (Moomoo CA entity) | Mobile app + account |
| **TradeStation SIM** | Yes | Maybe via International | Full account |
| **Questrade API** | Practice account exists but API order execution blocked for retail | Yes | — |
| **Wealthsimple** | No official API | — | — |
| **Twelve Data / Finnhub / FMP / Yahoo** | **NO — all data-only providers, no order execution** | — | — |

**Key insight**: None of the data providers (Twelve Data, Finnhub, FMP, Yahoo) offer paper trading APIs. Paper trading requires a broker API. Alpaca was the obvious choice but Canada is blocked. The app already has built-in paper trading via `paper_trades` table and `/api/paper/route.ts` — extending that is the right path forward.

## [2026-04-07 10:16] — Fix Surveillance Worker: Yahoo Finance Fallback for Stooq Block

**Area:** Trading/Surveillance, Trading/Data
**Type:** bugfix

### Files Changed
- `src/lib/data.ts` — Added Yahoo Finance chart API fallback in `fetchDailyBars()` when Stooq fails/blocks
- `src/app/api/surveillance/sync/route.ts` — Added missing `ensureSchema()` call

### Functions/Symbols Modified
- `fetchDailyBars()` — modified (Stooq-first with Yahoo fallback)
- `GET()` in sync route — modified (added ensureSchema)

### Database Tables
- `reversal_entries` — 2 new entries enrolled (PAYP, SEDG)
- `surveillance_logs` — 2 SUCCESS entries logged
- `prices_daily` — 20 AAPL rows from data refresh verification

### Summary
Verified the surveillance sync worker end-to-end. Discovered Stooq API blocks automated requests, silently breaking the trend analysis pipeline — movers were fetched from Yahoo but `enhanceWithTrend` failed on every Stooq call, leaving `consecutiveDays` undefined, and the `>= 2` filter removed all candidates. Added Yahoo Finance chart API as fallback in `fetchDailyBars()`. Also fixed missing `ensureSchema()` in the sync route. After fix: 10 gainers + 10 losers with trend data, 2 entries auto-enrolled.

- `src/app/api/reversal/movers/route.ts` — Added "most active" stocks fetch, switched to Promise.allSettled for partial failure resilience
- `src/app/api/reversal/route.ts` — Added input validation: date format, direction allowlist, positive price check
- `src/app/api/reversal/[id]/route.ts` — Added status allowlist validation, negative price guard, removed unused MeasurementField import
- `src/app/reversal/page.tsx` — Fixed 3 ESLint unescaped entity errors, removed unused MEASUREMENT_LABELS import
- `src/components/BacktestCritique.tsx` — Fixed ESLint unescaped entity error

- `ensureColumn()` — modified (whitelist validation, TOCTOU race fix)
- `parseCsv()` — modified (row validation)
- `loadPrices()` — modified (parameterized LIMIT)
- `fetchMovers()` — modified (accepts "most_actives" type)
- `GET /api/reversal/movers` — modified (3rd category, Promise.allSettled)

### Database Tables
- N/A (no schema changes, fixes were in application logic)

### Summary
Ran a comprehensive 5-agent parallel critic review on the trading platform. Found 43 issues (3 critical, 16 high, 14 medium, 10 low). Fixed 15 of the most impactful: division-by-zero in P&L calc, SAR flip cursor overwrite causing re-processed bars, SQL injection risk in ensureColumn, missing "most active" stocks category, CSV parser accepting malformed data, and 14 ESLint build-blocking errors. Identified 3 structural gaps that need design decisions: fully manual data collection (no automated price fetcher), entry price captured at click-time instead of market close, and regime filter logic inverted for fade strategies.

## [2026-04-11 14:01] — Trading Verification, Markets Chart Upgrade, Site Polish

**Area:** Trading/Markets, Trading/Strategy, Trading/Paper, Trading/UI
**Type:** feature + bugfix + verification

### Files Changed
- `src/app/api/strategies/route.ts` — fixed strategy equity accounting using marked open-position values
- `scripts/surveillance-cron.ts` — fixed auto-trader cash overspend path
- `scripts/backtest-strategies.ts` — enforced overlapping-position concurrency in backtests
- `docker/init-db.sql` — aligned deploy schema with paper-trading and strategy runtime schema
- `src/app/api/markets/route.ts` — added multi-range chart API support (`1d`, `5d`, `1mo`, `6mo`, `1y`)
- `src/app/markets/page.tsx` — rebuilt ticker UI with Yahoo-like range selector and interactive SVG chart
- `src/app/page.tsx` — rewrote landing page around actual surveillance → strategy → paper-execution flow
- `src/app/strategies/page.tsx` — rebuilt strategy dashboard around corrected account metrics
- `src/app/paper/page.tsx` — standardized copy and fixed effect/lint issue
- `src/components/AppShell.tsx` — improved IA with `Markets`, `Strategy Dashboard`, and quick-jump search
- `src/app/globals.css` — added ambient background styling

### Summary
Audited the recent trading work from scratch under the assumption that it was flawed. Found four high-signal issues: strategy dashboard equity double-counted realized P&L, strategy auto-trade could overspend accounts, backtest concurrency was effectively disabled, and deploy schema lagged runtime expectations. Fixed those issues first, then improved the site’s information architecture and landing flow.

Built a real ad-free ticker interface on `/markets` to cover the gap the user called out: live stats for any symbol, quick watchlist workflow, and historical chart ranges similar to Yahoo. The new flow supports `1D / 5D / 1M / 6M / 1Y` using Yahoo chart data with range-specific intervals and an interactive SVG chart.

Verification completed on the code path changed in this session:
- `npx tsc --noEmit` — passed
- targeted `eslint` on touched files — passed
- `npm run build` — passed

### Commit
- `909db98` — fix trading accounting and add multi-range markets charts
